        <p>Oleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev is known to be one of the best Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players in the world. Despite being first known as a paramount rifler, he began to showcase his amazing potential with the sniper rifles in Amazing Gaming and HellRaisers.

Having started his career in the game in 2013 with Ukrainian team LAN DODGERS, he was discovered in early 2014 after his impressive showings online, especially at StarSeries IX, where he played for Courage Gaming. Due to internal issues, however, Kostyliev parted company with the ex-Courage squad and returned to LAN DODGERS, which later became Amazing Gaming.

In mid-September 2014, s1mple saw his career elevated to new heights as he signed for HellRaisers, joining stars like Dosia and markeloff.[1] During this time in HellRaisers, s1mple started making waves internationally, most notably at DreamHack Winter 2014, where his team beat fnatic in the group stage, 16-14, leading to a top placement in their group. However, their run at the event ended in the quarter-finals, as they were dominantly beaten by Ninjas in Pyjamas, losing the series 2-0.

HellRaisers parted ways with s1mple about two months later, with the main reason for the decision being s1mple's ban from ESL tournaments (a notably harsh blow to his potential due to the two majors organized by ESL in 2015). His ban expired on February 1, 2016.</p>

s1mple then joined the predominantly Ukrainian Flipsid3 Tactics team. Due to his aforementioned ESL ban, players like DavCost and CyberFocus were often seen standing in for him at events managed by ESL. He left the squad on July 17, 2015 following internal problems, and later announced that he would be going inactive for the time being. However, he took a sudden U-turn to this decision only a few days later, as it was announced that he would join the revamped roster of Evolution, which later rebranded to Evolution.Dark. His Evolution.Dark story didn't last long however, as Evolution released the whole "Dark" squad after a month. However, the players would keep playing together under the name of Worst Players.

Just a few weeks later, it was announced that s1mple was going to stand in for his former team, HellRaisers, which had been looking for a fifth player after the surprising departure of Dosia.[2] Two weeks later, HellRaisers attended DreamHack Stockholm 2015, which was a qualifier for the upcoming Major, DreamHack Cluj-Napoca 2015. The team failed to qualify despite being a big favorite for a Major spot, as they lost to Titan eSports 1-2 in the winners' match, and were then upset 1-2 by Vexed Gaming, a team which they had defeated 2-0 a day earlier in the tournament.

S1mple became good friends with Hiko when the latter was playing as a stand-in for Flipsid3 Tactics, which would later lead to him recruiting s1mple to Team Liquid, a move that meant s1mple had to sacrifice his university course in the process. Team Liquid, with s1mple and Hiko, would go on to make it to the semi-finals of MLG Major Championship: Columbus 2016. At the same Major, s1mple was chosen for the NA vs EU All-Star Game on the NA side, which would go on to win the match in overtime. S1mple was awarded the All-Star MVP.

In August 2016, he joined the Ukrainian team Natus Vincere, replacing Danylo "Zeus" Teslenko. Although s1mple was very happy to fulfil his long-time dream of playing in Natus Vincere's ranks, the team's initial results were disappointing. After a series of failures, the team took home the trophy at ESL One New York 2016, but this was to be the last big victory for this roster. After a long period of re-shuffles, which saw long-time Natus Vincere players GuardiaN and seized replaced by a returning Zeus and rising young star electronic, the team was able to find success, and quickly rise in the HLTV team ratings. This new line-up led to notable victories, such as StarSeries & i-League CS:GO Season 5, CS:GO Asia Championships 2018, ESL One: Cologne 2018 and others.

s1mple has been featured on the HLTV Top 20 Players of the Year lists numerous times, finishing top of the rankings in 2018, due to unprecedented personal performance throughout the year, an achievement whose legacy he has carried into 2019, leading many to call him one of the best Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players of all time.</p>
